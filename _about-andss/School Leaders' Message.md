<p>The Ministry of Education has recently launched its revised <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/21st-century-competencies" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Framework for 21st Century Competencies and Student Outcomes</a>,
of which Adaptive Thinking is a new component. Indeed, in an ever-changing
world, the need to equip our younger generation with the resilience to
overcome challenges and obstacles, and grow their courage to thrive in
the midst of complex demands, has become even more imperative. At Anderson
Secondary School, this competency has always resonated strongly with us,
as our emblem, the bamboo, is the epitome of hardiness and flexibility
despite its humble identity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below are some examples of how our school hones our students’ capacity
for adaptive thinking:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Science Research Programme
(SRP), which all Sec 2 students undergo, cultivates in our students a spirit
of experimentation by giving them autonomy and space during curriculum
time to explore topics they may be interested in;</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We actively encourage students
to participate in innovation projects, such as the Innovation Programme
and Young Innovators’ Fair, where some of our Andersonians have done us
proud by conceptualising original and unique ideas to champion sustainability;
and</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We celebrate not just victories,
but also affirm commendable sportsmanship and effort demonstrated by our
students during tough competitions and matches, emphasising the importance
of the growth mindset and the role of defeat or failure in making progress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have also been fortunate to be able to resume our overseas exchanges.
We see these interactions and immersion experiences as invaluable opportunities
for our students to learn how to make connections in unfamiliar contexts,
and glean different perspectives on the world. A group of our students
visited our long-time partner school Winitsuksa School in Lopburi, Thailand
in November 2023, and we have been able to reciprocate the hospitality
by hosting our Thai friends from Winitsuksa School in March 2024. We are
looking forward to more in-person interactions with staff and students
of our other partner schools from Indonesia and China, over the course
of 2024.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By expanding their horizons, and bringing the world to them, we hope to
inject even more vibrancy and joy to the holistic development of our Andersonians
in 2024.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Constancy and Purpose,</p>
<p>ANDSS School Leaders</p>

Mr Shahreen Aman (VP(A))]</p>
