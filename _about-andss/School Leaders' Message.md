<p>2025 marks the 65th anniversary of our school’s founding. Over the many
years of our history, Anderson Secondary School has produced many graduates
whom we are proud of – not just due to their achievements, but more importantly,
because of their contributions to society. Some continue to serve the school
on our School Advisory Committee; some are in academia; some serve the
country in government and statutory boards; some have set up, or work in,
business enterprises that add value to our nation and even globally.</p>
<p>As School Leaders of ANDSS, when asked what success looks like for Andersonians,
we always return to the fundamental building blocks of human society –
good character and sound values. Mahatma Gandhi spoke about the danger
of “knowledge without character”. Indeed, a highly intelligent and competent
individual without a strong moral compass can unleash much harm on those
around him. A humble individual with a deep sense of other-directed purpose
and positive dispositions can, conversely, improve society, and/or influence
many others to change society for the better. It is ultimately our hope
that our Andersonians truly live out the values embodied by our emblem,
the unassuming and useful bamboo, and use their strengths, talents and
interests to serve others to make a difference for the greater good.</p>
<p>The theme of our 65th anniversary is “Warm Memories, Growing Together”.
Just as the bamboo grows in colonies rather than individually, Andersonians
lean on one another to grow together. Even as we hope to make an impact
on larger society, we recognise that we too are an important community
unto ourselves, and students can start making a difference by being kind
and encouraging to one another. Through the multiple leadership opportunities
we offer our students, we aim to develop them to look out for others as
they refine and actualise their vision for their project group, class,
and CCA. Cultivating empathy, the skill of perspective-taking, and curiosity
about others, helps our students gain the respect of others and thrive
as resilient learners. We are glad to have heard from members of public,
other colleagues in the fraternity, and our students themselves about how
Andersonians have shown heart for others, even during difficult or challenging
times, thereby perpetuating a virtuous circle of positivity and graciousness.</p>
<p>As we celebrate together this year, we will affirm the warm memories that
bind us together, and look ahead to the growth that is still to come for
all our Andersonians.</p>
