“Progress is what we aim for; success is in our sight.”

This is a line from our school song, The March of the Andersonians, and its meaning has become even more significant following the lifting of Covid-19 safe management measures. As we have learned from the pandemic, the future may sometimes become blurry and uncertain. Under such circumstances, it is only by feeling our way forward step by step, that we can come upon new vistas. Over the past three years, this is what Singapore has experienced, and the journey we have gone through as a nation has yielded many valuable lessons for our youth as well.

A community of diverse learners, Anderson Secondary School is committed to the growth of all our students. We celebrate the achievements, unique interests, and talents of Andersonians, and just as importantly, we support and affirm the development of their character as they learn from mistakes, reflect on their learning experiences, and put values into action by contributing to others’ lives. Initiatives and platforms such Andersonian of the Month, class Values In Action projects, Anderson’s Got Talent, ANDE Voices, talent development programmes, and school events provide milestones and opportunities for our students to discover strengths within themselves, gain confidence from interacting with a variety of peers and stakeholders, and practise leadership to make a difference for the greater good. Throughout all of these, our staff walk alongside our students, encouraging them and facilitating their learning as they overcome obstacles, advance, and blossom. 

Indeed, Andersonians understand that it is by helping and caring for one another that we make collective progress as a school, and on a larger scale, as a society. 2023 has started with many exciting activities that have allowed our students to cheer one another on and work through difficulties together, from overnight camps to research projects to the Cross-Country run, as well as competitions and performances. As educators, we are most heartened when we witness our students’ eyes light up with the joy of learning, and when we see them being inclusive towards one another and becoming stronger together. The beginning of 2023 has brought us many such moments, and we look forward to more as we work in partnership with parents, the community and other stakeholders to support the learning of our students.

With Constancy and Purpose,

ANDSS School Leaders
