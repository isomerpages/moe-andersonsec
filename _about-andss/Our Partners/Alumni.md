The Old Andersonian Alumni Society (OAAS) was officially created and registered with the Registry of Societies on 14 August 1999 with the primary intention of reaching out and engaging former students of Anderson Secondary School.  
  
This volunteer-driven Society supports the school in various events, which in turn nurtures and enhances camaraderie amongst former and current students and staff of the school. Furthermore it also seeks to encourage a sense of love and loyalty for the alma mater through meaningful alumni activities.
