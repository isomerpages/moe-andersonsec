2022 has been a fulfilling year for Anderson Secondary School. With the lifting of various Covid-19 safe management measures, our staff and students have embraced new opportunities to resume school life and further strengthen our sense of belonging as a school. Over the past year, Andersonians have taken the initiative to suggest, design and implement meaningful school-wide celebrations and commemorative events, where they honed their leadership and collaborative skills by mobilising resources to ensure that their friends’ voices were heard, and their diverse talents, represented. Whether in or out of the classroom, Andersonians also found new ways to work with one another to achieve common goals during group projects, competitions, elective modules and camps, caring for and encouraging one another when they encountered challenges and obstacles. In addition, Andersonians eagerly sought out opportunities to contribute to various community sectors, using their passion and ingenuity to raise awareness about worthwhile causes as well as to do their part to enhance the lives of others around them, ranging from those who live in our neighbourhood to the underprivileged in society.

2022 also marked the 20th year Anderson Secondary School hosted the Elementz Science Project Competition for primary and secondary schools in the North Zone and beyond. We were grateful for the opportunity to host the event in person during this milestone year, as the lively interactions between the participants, and the hands-on workshops offered by F1 in Schools Singapore and the Science Centre, allowed for a high level of engagement and fruitful exchanges about the place of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) in the world. Through this and many other platforms such as ongoing STEM workshops and our year-long Science Research Programme in Secondary Two, our students learn to appreciate the importance of curiosity, resilience and discipline, and increase their confidence to experiment and challenge boundaries in healthy and constructive ways.

Indeed, our colleagues recognise the importance of nurturing such dispositions and competencies in our students through the total curriculum, as we are keenly aware that these values, mindsets and skillsets – whether cultivated through a subject discipline, physical and outdoor education, Co-Curricular Activities, exposure to vibrant enrichment activities, or leadership development opportunities – will best prepare our students to remain flexible and learn for life. Our diverse Andersonians also bring with them a wealth of multiple perspectives and experiences, and we are committed to harnessing this potential so that they can build on one another’s insights and strengths to grow both individually and together.

We look forward to journeying alongside our students with Constancy and Purpose in 2023.
