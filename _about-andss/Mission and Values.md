**Motto**

Our school motto, “With Constancy and Purpose”, worded by Miss Heng CS, a former Principal of our school, serves to urge Andersonians to imbibe the qualities of the bamboo, which grows with constancy and is versatile. It also encourages Andersonians to set goals in life and be consistent in their pursuit of these goals.
