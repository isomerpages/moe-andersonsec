Anderson Secondary School seeks to provide fulfilling and enriching experiences for our students through various activities. Photographs and/or videos of students and/or our stakeholders may be captured during such events, and may be used in the schoolâ€™s publicity materials, e.g. publications (yearbook, brochures), banners, as well as social media (school website, Facebook, Instagram). Individuals attending an event organised by the school are deemed to have given their consent for such usage, by virtue of their attendance or participation in the event. Any objections or concerns with regard to this should be raised with the school via anderson_ss@moe.edu.sg.
