**National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP)**

**Overview**

The NDLP was launched in March 2020 to make digital learning inclusive by equipping students with the digital literacies to be future-ready.

 

Under the NDLP, MOE announced in 2020 that every student will own a school-prescribed personal learning device (PLD) by end-2021. Singapore Citizen students can use their Edusave Account to pay for the PLD.

 


The Personal Learning Device (PLD) will be used in tandem with the national e-learning platform – the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) – as well as other educational technology to personalise and enhance students’ learning. This will also better enable students to acquire digital skills and apply these skills as they navigate an increasingly digitalised world. Students will also acquire digital literacy in the four components of Ministry of Education (MOE)’s Digital Literacy Framework:

Personal Learning Device

Every Andersonian will be using the Apple iPad as their personal learning device. Each iPad will come bundled with the Apple pencil and keyboard to maximise the affordances of the iPad as a learning tool.


Not only is the iPad a portable and durable device that offers students the ability to learn anytime and anywhere, it also allows for a seamless learning experience alongside existing learning technologies such as the Student Learning Space (SLS) and the wide range of educational and productivity apps within Apple’s eco-system. The rich teaching and learning affordances of the iPad such as the inking function, screen recording, and multimedia editing makes it the device of choice in developing students’ digital literacy and creative skills.


Each bundle consists of:

**Supporting Students in the Safe and Effective Use of the Devices**

The school has measures in place to enable a safe and conducive learning environment for students in the use of PLDs for teaching and learning, e.g.

·        Classroom management and routines

·        Educating students on Cyber Wellness

·        Device Management Application (DMA)



The school also has strategies to enable school-wide implementation of CCE. These include:

**·        Cyberwellness Ambassador Programme**

ICT Cyber Wellness Student Ambassadors role model safe and responsible online behaviours in their respective classes. They create a positive presence online and advice peers on the appropriate online behaviours. Additionally, they report inappropriate or upsetting online behaviours.



**·        Cyberwellness Assembly Talks**



Assembly talks are conducted regularly to educate students to be responsible digital learners and engage in appropriate online behaviour and etiquette.  In 2021, we have had speakers guide our students over the appropriate use of social media, the impact of cyber bullying, and the promotion of healthy and balanced gaming habits.

In addition, through various programmes in school, students will continue to learn to be respectful, safe, and responsible users of technology.
