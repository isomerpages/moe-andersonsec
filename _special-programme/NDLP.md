<p><strong>National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP)</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Overview</strong>
</p>
<p>The NDLP was launched in March 2020 to help students strengthen their
digital literacy and acquire digital skills needed to navigate an increasingly
digitalized world.</p>
<p>Under the NDLP, every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed
Personal Learning Device (PLD). Students may use funds from their Edusave
Account&nbsp;to pay for the PLD.</p>
<p>The Personal Learning Device (PLD) will be used in tandem with the national
e-learning platform – the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) – as well
as other educational technology to personalize and enhance students’ learning.
This will also better enable students to acquire and apply digital skills
as they navigate an increasingly digitalized world. Students will also
acquire digital literacy in the four components of Ministry of Education’s
Digital Literacy Framework:</p>

<p><strong>What is the PLD in Anderson?</strong>
</p>
<p>Every Andersonian will be using the Apple iPad as their personal learning
device. Each iPad will come bundled with the Apple pencil and keyboard
to maximize the affordances of the iPad as a learning tool.</p>
<p>Not only is the iPad a portable and durable device that offers students
the ability to learn anytime and anywhere, it also allows for a seamless
learning experience alongside existing learning technologies such as the
Student Learning Space (SLS) and the wide range of educational and productivity
apps within Apple’s eco-system. The rich teaching and learning affordances
of the iPad such as the inking function, screen recording and multimedia
editing makes it the device of choice in developing students’ digital literacy
and creative skills.</p>
<p><strong>How will Andersonians use their PLDs?</strong>
</p>
<p>Every Andersonian will be using his/her PLD for the following:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; active learning in all subjects,</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alternative assessments that
require research, digital creation, and collaborative learning,</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emerging Digital Technologies
modules.</p>

<p><strong>Supporting Andersonians in the Safe and Effective Use of the Devices</strong>
</p>
<p>The school has measures in place to enable a safe and conducive learning
environment for Andersonians in the use of PLDs for teaching and learning.
These are</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; classroom management and routines,</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cyber Wellness education and,</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Device Management Application
(DMA).</p>
<p>The school also has strategies to enable school-wide implementation of
CCE. These include <strong>Cyber Wellness Education in CCE (Educating students on Cyber Wellness)</strong>.</p>
<p>MOE has made significant changes to the Character and Citizenship Education
(CCE) curriculum. Cyber Wellness lessons will feature significantly in
these lessons.</p>
<p>The broad topics covered in Cyber Wellness are Cyber Use, Cyber Identity,
Cyber Relationships, Cyber Citizenship and Cyber Ethics.</p>
<p>Throughout their Secondary School education, Andersonians will learn about</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; balanced use and self-control,</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cyber bullying and Upstanding,</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how to be a positive influence
online,</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how to handle online falsehoods,</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how to manage social media
(peer influence, emotions, echo chambers),</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; online relationship and online
safety (grooming, self-disclosure) and</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; respect for intellectual property
rights.</p>
<p>In addition to these, through various programmes in school, Andersonians
will continue to learn to be respectful, safe, and responsible users of
technology.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Resources for Parents</strong>

and have conversations with your child/ward about safe and responsible
