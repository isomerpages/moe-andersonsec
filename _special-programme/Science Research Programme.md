**Mission**

To develop Anderson Secondary School into a premier centre for science research & development to serve the school and the zone.

**Overview**

Life Science and Biomedical Research is the fourth pillar of the Singapore economy. With an eye towards the future, Anderson has identified Science Research and Innovation as its niche area since 2000. Every subsequent year has seen more achievements made by the students groomed in this area. In recognition of this, Anderson was awarded the status of Centre of Excellence for Science Research. To further enhance our strengths in this area, a level-wide Science Research Project (SRP) was incorporated into the secondary two science curriculum in 2005. This has equipped all our students with the knowledge and understanding of life sciences and their effects on the world around us. The Science Specialist Programme was established in 2007 to nurture young scientists to undertake cutting-edge life science research in the school.

**Features of Science Research Programme**


| |  | 
| -------- | -------- | 
| Research Skills | Science lessons introduce and re-enforce the Scientific Inquiry processes. <br><br>Science projects at every level allow students to read and research on a wide variety of topics. <br><br>SRP provides the platform for students to explore their interest in research, sharpen their research skills and practice working in teams.
|Communication Competency|Oral fluency is enhanced through discussions and class presentations.<br><br>ICT skills are encouraged during literature research, referencing and powerpoint presentations. <br><br>Writing skills are polished through scientific reporting and essay writing.<br><br>Poster presentations provide opportunities for students to merging of creative and scientific skills to effectively create attractive visuals.<br><br>Students are given the opportunities to serve as facilitators in different activities and this develops their communications skills to a wide range of audience.
|Leadership development|Working on research projects encourage students to speak up and take the lead in various aspects. <br><br>Students serve as guides and facilitators to younger students which develop their leadership potential.<br><br>Senior science specialists act as mentors to their juniors and teach, advice and guide them.<br><br>Leadership qualities are enhanced and developed by involving students in planning, executing and reviewing many of the activities conducted throughout the year.
|Immersion Opportunities|Students have opportunities to participate in exchange programmes with other schools in other countries such as the USA and New Zealand.<br><br>Availability of attachment opportunities with IMCB, A*STAR, NUS and selected organisations to train and expose students to the world of scientific research.


**For The Students:**

Basic Module:

Students attend a foundation course in Life Science and Research skills. Every secondary one student participates in a series of workshops to gain theoretical as well as practical knowledge. As an extended part of the secondary one science curriculum, the students are taught how to formulate the hypothesis and design experiments with the relevant set of variables.

**Science Workshops for Students Advanced Module:**

Armed with the skills and knowledge acquired in the basic module, all the secondary two express students are involved in a year-long Science Research Project (SRP) as part of the science curriculum. Students will conceptualise, plan, carry out and present their scientific experiments.

Students with an aptitude and keen interest in science will be identified and selected to attend more advanced science research workshops. These students are the Science Specialists.

**Research and Development (R&D):**

Upper secondary science students are offered opportunities for attachment to various institutions involved in science research.

Science Specialists work in research teams to design and conduct experiments to take part in science competitions. They are also trained to be facilitators and mentors in various science department activities. More able students will be able to participate in the national level Science Mentorship Programme (SMP).
