**Elective Programme for Malay Language in Secondary School**

Being an Elective Programme for Malay Language in Secondary School (EMAS) centre, the Malay Language Unit also provides an opportunity for students to speak and use the language in an environment that promotes an exclusive use of the language. Through a variety of language, cultural and literary activities, the programme aims to enhance students’ overall proficiency in the language and create a deep interest in developing and appreciating the Malay culture.

The Malay Language Elective Programme students actively participated in various cultural activities such as the Sec 3 Malay Literature Script Writing Workshop and Dialogue session with writers. This has enhanced their understanding of Malay literature and developed the students’ love for reading.
