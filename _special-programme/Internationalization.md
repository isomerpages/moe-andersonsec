<p><strong><u>EXCHANGE PROGRAMMES</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The school strongly believes in preparing students for a globalising environment,
aiming to enhance their cross-cultural sensitivities and foster interpersonal
skills through cultural immersion experiences and interactions with students
from our partner schools.</p>
<p>In a significant milestone, this marks the first year since the onset
of Covid-19 that we have resumed physical overseas trips and had the privilege
of organizing three overseas trips. Additionally, we continued our online
Internationalisation Programme which was conducted via Zoom.</p>
<p><strong><u>ONLINE EXCHANGES</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Internationalization Programme with SMPK 1 BPK Penabur School, Bandung, Indonesia</u></strong>
<br>On 31 March 2023, Secondary 2 students from Anderson Secondary School
had the chance to partake in the Internationalization Programme alongside
SMPK 1 BPK Penabur School in Bandung, Indonesia. This marked the third
consecutive year of collaboration between the schools for an online exchange
programme. The programme involved 29 and 27 students from Bandung and Anderson
respectively, who worked together to establish new friendships and facilitate
cultural exchange during interactive sessions.</p>
<p>Prior to the online sessions with Penabur students, an Indonesian trainer
taught Anderson participants conversational Bahasa Indonesia. This pre-session
proved valuable as it equipped students to interact with their Penabur
counterparts more confidently. Additionally, a Bandung Food Experience
session exposed students to Indonesian cuisine, enhancing their cultural
immersion. Despite the virtual nature of the interaction, teachers and
students from both schools thoroughly enjoyed the sessions. The presentation
segment showcased the students' confidence and eloquence, underscoring
their dedicated preparation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This programme contributed to the development of interpersonal and communication
skills, as well as fostering empathy among students from both schools.
Beyond these skills, it played a crucial role in building an understanding
and appreciation of each other's cultures, fostering a deeper connection
between the neighboring countries.</p>

</p>
<p>The Internationalization Programme with Shanghai Experimental School (China)
took place on 10 November 2023, marking the third consecutive online exchange
between the two schools. 18 Sec 3 and Sec 2 students from Anderson, alongside

<p>Throughout the programme, students from both schools engaged in interactive
sessions and presentations in both Mandarin and English. The diverse topics
shared provided profound insights into Chinese and Singaporean cultures,
as well as the lives of teenagers in both regions. An intriguing bilingual
forum, centred around the topic 'Will AI dominate mankind in the future?',
allowed students to showcase their confidence and fluency. The evident
dedication to preparing presentation materials reflected a high standard
of participation.</p>
<p>During interaction sessions, students enjoyed meaningful conversations,
fostering a deeper understanding of each other's cultures. Overall, the
student participants from both schools not only had an enjoyable time but

<p><strong><u>OVERSEAS TRIPS</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Trip to Lopburi &amp; Bangkok, Thailand</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Our school organized the Anderson-Winitsuksa Exchange Programme from &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5
to 10 November 2023. 20 Sec 2 and 3 students embarked on this enriching
journey.</p>
<p>The Director of School, Phra Thepsenabordee, and all Winitsuksa School
staff and students warmly welcomed and generously hosted their Singaporean
visitors. The trip gained media coverage from the local Wanom Channel,
featuring students performing a traditional dance at Wichayen House in
traditional costumes.</p>
<p>On the first day at Winitsuksa School, students from both schools engaged
in group presentations, sharing insights into their respective histories,
cultures, and the lives of teenagers. Additionally, they delved into class
immersion, actively participating in discussions to gain a deeper understanding
of the teaching and learning dynamics in a Thai classroom. This immersive
experience added a profound layer to the cultural exchange, breaking down
barriers and enriching the overall learning journey.</p>
<p>During the afternoon learning journey, Anderson staff and students were
taken to the impressive Pa Sak Cholasit Dam Project, a crucial irrigation
initiative supplying water to plantations in the Pa Sak and lower Chao
Phraya valleys. The tram ride along the scenic 4,860m dam filled our students
with exhilaration. A delightful pause at the Flower House Café &amp; Bistro
allowed students to enjoy sweet refreshments while relishing a wonderful
view of the flowers, providing a serene break before the next adventure.</p>
<p>Another fascinating location was Wichayen House, a historical gem located
just 300 metres from Prang Khaek. In traditional Thai costumes, students
explored the historical site and captured joyful memories.</p>
<p>Amidst all these cultural explorations, it is worth noting that all students
enjoyed delectable Thai cuisines and were very pleased. This culinary delight
added another layer to the cultural immersion, as flavours of Thai dishes
became an integral part of the overall experience.</p>
<p>A significant highlight was the Joint Performance (Mini-Concert) during
the farewell lunch. Students from both schools showcased their talents,
celebrating the unity and diversity of Singaporean and Thai cultures. This
mini concert provided a platform for students to share their artistic expressions,
fostering a deeper appreciation for each other's backgrounds.</p>
<p>As the participants bid farewell to their new-found friends and these
remarkable places, the echoes of laughter, appreciation for Thai culture,
and the lingering taste of Thai cuisine left lasting memories.</p>

<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>EMAS &amp; MLEP Trip to Kedah &amp; Penang (14 – 18 Nov 2023)</u></strong>
<br>69 students and 9 teachers from Anderson Secondary School, Tanjong Katong
Secondary School, and Bukit Panjang Government High School participated
in a programme organized by the Ministry of Education (MOE). The students
engaged in Malay conversations, gaining a deeper understanding of the Nusantara
region's ethnic groups, languages, cultures, and traditions. The trip showcased
the relevance of the Malay language in neighbouring countries and fostered
collaborative work among students from all three EMAS &amp; MLEP centres.</p>
<p>The visit to SMK Syed Mohamed Al-Bukhary School involved discussions on
Malay Literature, cultural exchanges, and presentations by students from
both schools. The primary aim was to promote cultural exchange and mutual
learning. Additionally, students visited Kedah State Museum to witness
Mek Mulung, a traditional art form, and participated in a hands-on experience
with trainers and dancers, culminating in a collective performance.</p>
<p>The poetry writing workshop session focused on introducing and sharing
various poetry writing techniques. Group activities were incorporated to
enhance engagement. Each group participated by sharing and presenting their
poems, receiving feedback from Swadaya. This interactive session fostered
creativity, collaboration, and dialogue in the exploration of poetry writing.</p>
<p>The visit to Suka Ramai Rice Mill included a guided tour of the mill situated
amidst picturesque paddy fields. The subsequent morning offered students
the opportunity to explore a bee farm at Taman Madu Lebah Bukit Besar.
They sampled 'madu kelulut,' honey from stingless honeybees, known for
its slightly sour and less sweet taste.</p>
<p>In Penang, participants enjoyed a captivating Boria performance by the
renowned Boria Omara troupe in Malaysia. The event included interactive
discussions, offering valuable insights into the intricacies of this rich
art form. Students were grouped into three categories, namely singing,
dancing, and acting, to explore various aspects of the Boria performance,
resulting in a rewarding and meaningful experience.</p>

<p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Layar Nusantara 1 : &nbsp;Trip to Johor Bahru</u></strong>
</p>
<p>On 17 November 2023, 18 Sec 2 and Sec 4 students participated in a day
trip to Johor Bahru.</p>
<p>The excursion provided students a unique opportunity to explore their
culture and language. They engaged in interviews with locals, gained insights
into local produce as well as immersed themselves in Kampung culture through
visits and conversations with Kampung residents.</p>
<p>The day included a visit to a traditional kampung near the foothills of
Gunung Pulai, located at Pontian. Students observed a variety of tropical
plants and had a hands-on experience with ducks, kampong chickens, and
goats. Activities such as playing ‘gasing’, weaving rattan baskets, and
trying their hand at making ‘ondeh-ondeh’ enriched the experience.</p>
<p>A traditional kampong lunch, Nasi Ambang, added a communal touch as students
and staff sat on floor mats, enjoying the fragrant Javanese cuisine. This
excursion not only encourages students to actively use the Malay language
but also deepens their understanding of Malay culture within the broader
Malay Archipelago.</p>
