It takes a village to raise a child. Anderson Secondary School works together with parents and the broader community in the upbringing and education of our students - helping them to develop their character, and play an active role in society, the nation, and beyond.


Parents play a pivotal role in educating their children. However, parents face many challenges and many of such challenges are unexpected!

In order to support parents in their parenting journey, MSF has, since 2019, appointed ten Parenting Support Providers (PSPs) to deliver parenting support services on a regional basis. The PSPs are one-stop service providers which work closely with schools within their allocated regions, to deliver evidence-based parenting programmes and provide follow-on counselling support to parents who need it.


AMKFSC Community Services Ltd. is the PSP appointed to support parents in Anderson Secondary School. The video below is a summary of the parenting programmes and support they offer.
