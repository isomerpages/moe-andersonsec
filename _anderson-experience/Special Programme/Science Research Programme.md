**Mission**

To develop Anderson Secondary School into a premier centre for science research & development to serve the school and the zone.

**Overview**

Life Science and Biomedical Research is the fourth pillar of the Singapore economy. With an eye towards the future, Anderson has identified Science Research and Innovation as its niche area since 2000. Every subsequent year has seen more achievements made by the students groomed in this area. In recognition of this, Anderson was awarded the status of Centre of Excellence for Science Research. To further enhance our strengths in this area, a level-wide Science Research Project (SRP) was incorporated into the secondary two science curriculum in 2005. This has equipped all our students with the knowledge and understanding of life sciences and their effects on the world around us. The Science Specialist Programme was established in 2007 to nurture young scientists to undertake cutting-edge life science research in the school.
