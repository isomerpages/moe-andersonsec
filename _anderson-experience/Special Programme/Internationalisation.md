**SINGAPORE-THAILAND ENHANCED PARTNERSHIP (STEP) CAMP**

When STEP, an annual exchange programme, began in 1998, only five secondary schools from Singapore and five schools from Thailand were involved. In 2002, another five schools from Singapore (two primary and three secondary schools) and another five schools from Thailand were recruited. From then onwards, ten Singapore schools and ten Thailand schools have been participating in this annual exchange programme.

Anderson Secondary School is one of the ten schools in Singapore that has been participating in STEP. Under this student exchange programme, the Singapore’s Ministry of Education works in partnership with educational institutes in Thailand to organise educational programmes with the following objectives:

a) to promote bilateral ties between Singapore and Thailand; 
b) to foster increased international standing, collaboration and bonding between our students and Thai students through cross-cultural learning and learning experiences; and 
c) to imbue in our students a global perspective and fresh insights on life outside of Singapore through immersion in a foreign culture and way of life. 

In 2018, STEP was held in Singapore and took place between 1 July and 8 July 2018. The exchange programme included a camp, visits to places of educational and cultural interests, classroom immersions, and hosting experience. Mr Teo Siang Yang, Ms Soh Si Ying and ten Sec 2 students represented our school in this programme.
