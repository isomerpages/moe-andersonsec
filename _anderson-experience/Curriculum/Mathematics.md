<p><strong>Department Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p>Continuing our efforts in spearheading the infusing of Computational Thinking
into our Mathematics curriculum, the department aims to develop students'
critical and inventive thinking skills and equip students with strong problem-solving
skills. Enrichment programmes such as the Code for Fun programme was also
held to provide students further opportunities to apply Computational Thinking
concepts and programming methodologies to solve real world problems.</p>

<p>With a strong belief that learning mathematics should be interesting and
fun, the department believes in designing teaching strategies and resources
to make the learning of mathematics authentic and engaging. From using
exploratory activities to learn concepts to competing against classmates
in online quizzes and escape rooms… completing mathematics homework can
also be as fun as playing a board game! Why not!</p>

<p><strong>Achievements</strong>
</p>
<p>Each year, we provide opportunities for our students to participate and
excel in various mathematics competitions. These include the American Mathematics
Competition, Singapore Mathematics Project Festival (SMPF) and the Singapore
Mathematical Olympiad.</p>
<p>In the SMPF 2023, a team of Sec 4 students achieved a Gold Award with
their project entitled “Calculating the Future Position of Vehicles with
the Idea of Odometry And Constants”. Two other projects entitled “Advisor’s
Chess: Increasing Probability of Winning in Chess” and “How to Enhance
One Time Passwords” also won Honourable Mention Awards. All our student
participants did extensive research and stretched their mathematics knowledge
and inventive thinking skills to come up with creative solutions to tackle
real world problems. Our heartiest congratulations for all their achievements!</p>

<p><em>“Personally, my entire SMPF journey had impacted me way beyond my academic pursuits. It was an invaluable first-hand experience in completing a mathematics related report. It had also opened my mind that mathematics plays a major part in our everyday lives. The skills that I have acquired will stand me in good stead for many years to come. Overall, I am thankful to have been given the opportunity to take part in the 2023 SMPF.” </em>
