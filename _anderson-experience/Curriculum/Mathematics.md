**Vision**

Excellence in the teaching and learning of Mathematics to nurture self-directed Mathematics learners and analytical problem solvers




**Mission**

To steer the direction of the Mathematics department with the following aims for our Andersonians:

Learn to learn
<br>Enjoy Mathematics
<br>Appreciate & apply
<br>Reflect on learning
<br>Never give up




**Subjects offered by Department**


1.   Mathematics


2.   Additional Mathematics




**Key programmes of Department**


**Code for Fun Programme**

In May - July 2021, the Code for Fun programme was conducted for our whole cohort of Secondary 1 students. This programme aims to nurture students’ interest in computational thinking through the use of microcontrollers, robotics and coding. 

The students were tasked to use the skills and knowledge that they have picked up in the programme to work on a group project as their Mathematics Alternative Assessment for Term 3. Students were seen exercising their creativity and critical thinking skills to design fun and interesting games which tapped on Mathematics concepts they have learnt.

“The programme exposes students to computational thinking concepts where students are taught how to decompose problems and analyse what they see before coming up with a solution/algorithm to solve the problem. It has given students a glimpse towards programming logic and help them use computational thinking to create a carnival game.” - Mr Aaron Wong, Teacher

**Teaching Mathematics with the Use of Comics** 

The “MAGICAL” project, which stands for “Mathematics is Great : I Can And Like”, is an initiative led by Associate Professor Toh Tin Lam from the Mathematics and Mathematics Education Academic Group (MME), National Institute of Education (NIE). It was started in 2014, with Anderson Secondary School on board since 2016.

The project explores an alternative approach to teaching Mathematics using comics, and aims to spark off more interest towards the learning of Mathematics and its real-life applications. Through a customised online platform on which students read comics and apply Mathematics to solve problems related to the comics, the learning of Mathematics concepts is made more interesting and enjoyable. Students also expressed that they were better able to understand and remember the concepts due to the humorous perspectives illustrated by the comics. 
The department will continue to work with NIE on this project in the following year to provide students with more quality learning experiences through the use of MAGICAL comics. 

Each year, Andersonians are given various opportunities to participate in Mathematics competitions such as the American Math Competition, Singapore Mathematical Olympiad Project Festival, Singapore Mathematical Olympiad Competition, etc.

**Singapore Mathematics Project Festival (SMPF) 2021**

In preparation for this prestigious competition, organized by the Singapore Mathematical Society, our students worked extremely hard over a period of six months on interesting projects that require them to make use of mathematical reasoning to solve real-world problems.

For the Junior Section, under the supervision of Mr Tay Jun Keat, the team comprising Wang Yuqi (3/2), Natanat Pocha (3/3), Ng Jerica (3/3), and Matthias Phua (3/5) worked on the project “Determining The Best Seat(s) In A Movie Cinema”. The students did an extensive research study on the measurements and layouts of cinema theatres and made numerical calculations and deductions that allowed them to determine the best seats in the house. For their clear and concise illustration of their project findings, they were awarded the Excellent Presentation Award.

For the Senior Section, under the supervision of Mr Mohd Alfin, the team comprising Gallardo Lee (4/1), Das Debansha (4/1) and Lyn Qinhang (4/1) worked on the project “Optimizing Angle of Reflection Of A Robotic Vacuum Cleaner”. The team investigated the optimal angle to launch the robotic vacuum cleaner such that it maximizes the area covered while keeping the distance travelled and time taken at a minimum. This project won the team an Honourable Mention.  

“I enjoyed this project because I was able to understand how Math concepts are incorporated in the real world context. Mr Tay and my group mates made the process of the project much easier as they contributed greatly as well.” <br>- Wang Yuqi, 3/2

“I feel that this project is really meaningful as it allows us to put what we have learnt in class into use. At the same time, we are also able to expose ourselves to more Math knowledge and explore different ways to solve a problem. I feel that this is a really good way for those interested in Math to build a deeper interest in it.” <br>- Ng Jerica, 3/3

“This project provides the students with the opportunity to solve their everyday problems using real mathematical concepts. The joy of seeing the students learning new things as they conduct their research has been the most fulfilling part of this journey.”  <br>- Mr Tay Jun Keat, Supervisor of SMPF Junior Team


**All Singapore Secondary Mathematics NA/NT Competition 2021**

Organised by Clementi Town Secondary School, this competition aims to stimulate greater interest in Mathematics and enrich students’ knowledge about Mathematics. It also provides an opportunity for Normal Course students to showcase their talent in mathematical knowledge and skills through solving competition questions. 

Selected students underwent specialised training during the June Holidays to prepare for this competition. We are pleased to announce that our students have done us proud in the competition, clinching the top team award for Upper Secondary NT category among other individual awards.
