Key programmes of Department


Code for Fun Programme

In May - July 2021, the Code for Fun programme was conducted for our whole cohort of Secondary 1 students. This programme aims to nurture students’ interest in computational thinking through the use of microcontrollers, robotics and coding. 

The students were tasked to use the skills and knowledge that they have picked up in the programme to work on a group project as their Mathematics Alternative Assessment for Term 3. Students were seen exercising their creativity and critical thinking skills to design fun and interesting games which tapped on Mathematics concepts they have learnt.

“The programme exposes students to computational thinking concepts where students are taught how to decompose problems and analyse what they see before coming up with a solution/algorithm to solve the problem. It has given students a glimpse towards programming logic and help them use computational thinking to create a carnival game.” - Mr Aaron Wong, Teacher
