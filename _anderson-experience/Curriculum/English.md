<p><strong>Vision</strong>
</p>
<p>The English and Literature Department aims to develop confident speakers
and critical thinkers who respect and empathise with others. This is achieved
through the implementation of a rigorous English curriculum and various
language-related activities organised for Andersonians.</p>
<p>By the end of their Secondary school experience, Andersonians should possess
intellectual curiosity and mental agility. Not only will they be well-informed
about world and local affairs, they will have the ability to evaluate and
synthesise information critically.</p>
<p><strong>Subjects offered by Department</strong>
</p>
<p>English Language
<br>Lower Secondary Literature
<br>Upper Secondary Literature (Elective)
<br>Upper Secondary Literature
<br>English Reading Programme</p>
<p>Our Reading Programme aims to expose our students to a wide range of articles,
short stories, essays and poetry. Through this weekly dose of knowledge,
we hope that our students will develop a deep sense of appreciation for
the language. This activity takes place every Tuesday and Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>This year marked the first time that monthly thematic readers were specially
curated for our Lower Secondary students. Students were exposed to various
perspectives and insights through an assortment of selected articles that
were subsequently discussed in their English lessons.</p>
<p>To increase engagement and students’ exposure to intertextuality, reading
sessions for the Upper Secondary students consisted of watching Ted-talks,
followed by a related reading article. These initiatives encouraged the
students to engage actively with what they had read and make connections
to their own lives.</p>
<p>In order to encourage students to think beyond themselves, the school
population participated in the National Reading Movement initiative called
‘Read For Books’. By reading together for fifteen minutes, students were
able to share the gift of reading with the less privileged as one book
per ten readers would be donated to selected beneficiaries. It was heartening
to observe students participate in this worthy cause!</p>

<p><strong>Sabbatical Book Club</strong>
</p>
<p>To further cultivate the joy of reading, our student, Christine Kho from
4/1 facilitated a book club session during the mid-year Sabbatical. Like-minded
individuals from Secondary 1 to 3 gathered on Zoom to hear more about her
book recommendations and shared more about the books they were currently
reading. At the end of the session, the members of this select group spontaneously
formed an informal book club to continue sharing more about the books they
read!</p>

<p><strong>National Schools Literature Festival 2021</strong>
</p>
<p>The National Schools Literature Festival (NSLF) is the biggest literary
festival for students in Singapore and has provided a powerful platform
to deepen their passion and love for Literature as well as gain greater
exposure to the world of Literature beyond the classroom. Every year, our
students participate actively in the literary festival and this year was
no exception. Despite the challenges faced due to the Covid-19 pandemic,
our Secondary 1 and 2 students persisted and enthusiastically participated
in the Choral Speaking and Book Trailer categories of the festival – creatively
thinking out of the box as they prepared a virtual performance that adhered
to the specified Safe Management Measures (SMM).</p>
<p>In the Choral Speaking category, the team, made up of our Secondary 1
Express students, performed a choral speaking piece on the poem, "Journey
of a Lifetime” by Sultana Ahmed while our Secondary 2 Express students
prepared a book trailer on the play, "Don't Know, Don't Care" by Haresh
Sharma. Both teams were awarded the Commendation Award – this was indeed
an achievement given that both categories received over 50 entries. Congratulations
to both teams!</p>

<p><strong>Literature Debate Workshop</strong>
</p>
<p>During the March school holidays, our Secondary 4 Pure and Elective Literature
students participated in the Debate Workshop cum Competition organised
by the department. The Debate Workshop, conducted by debate coach, Mr Edwin
Tham, sharpened our students' critical thinking skills and equipped them
with strategies to form compelling and persuasive arguments, both of which
are essential in their writing and daily lives. The workshop ended with
a heated debate challenge between our Pure and Elective Literature students
where they put into practice what they had learnt from the workshop. Congratulations
to the winning teams and our best speakers!</p>
