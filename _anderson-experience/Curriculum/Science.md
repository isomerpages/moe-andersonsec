**Key programmes of Department**

In Anderson, we have an integrated framework that provides a dynamic Science learning environment for students with the aim of fostering critical and inventive thinking as well as developing communication skills in our students. Through an inquiry-based science curriculum and programmes like Science Research Programme and Enrichment workshops, students have the opportunity to develop their capabilities and interests in various scientific fields. 


1) Science Enrichment Workshops and Learning Journeys

A series of Enrichment workshops and learning journeys have been organized outside curriculum time for Secondary 1 to 3 students, aimed at grooming students into thinkers and innovators. Some of the workshops were water purification technologies, laboratory skills in the area of microorganisms and renewable energy using Lego. Learning journeys to National University of Singapore Science Demonstration Labs were also organized to allow secondary 3 students to discover Science through hands-on activities and interactive learning.
