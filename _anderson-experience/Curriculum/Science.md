**Key programmes of Department**

In Anderson, we have an integrated framework that provides a dynamic Science learning environment for students with the aim of fostering critical and inventive thinking as well as developing communication skills in our students. Through an inquiry-based science curriculum and programmes like Science Research Programme and Enrichment workshops, students have the opportunity to develop their capabilities and interests in various scientific fields. 


1) Science Enrichment Workshops and Learning Journeys

A series of Enrichment workshops and learning journeys have been organized outside curriculum time for Secondary 1 to 3 students, aimed at grooming students into thinkers and innovators. Some of the workshops were water purification technologies, laboratory skills in the area of microorganisms and renewable energy using Lego. Learning journeys to National University of Singapore Science Demonstration Labs were also organized to allow secondary 3 students to discover Science through hands-on activities and interactive learning.

2) Science Research Programme (SRP)

SRP aims to infuse Science research skills and methods into the Lower Secondary Science Curriculum. Beyond lower secondary level, the Science Specialist Programme also provides the upper secondary students with an opportunity to  learn about the latest research developments from our partners in institutes of higher learning. In this programme, students participate in science research projects that undergraduates in our local universities are involved in. 


3) Anderson Science Week

The department has organised a series of activities to enhance students’ interest and exposure to science in real world context. Career talks by scientists from A*STAR, Mixology show by Science Centre, exhibits on the science behind how fireworks and vaccine works, and inter-class quizzes were some of the activities in which students learnt Science in engaging and authentic contexts.

4) 19th Elementz Science Project Competition 

Elementz Science Project Competition is an annual Science fair organized by our school for the North Zone primary and lower secondary students. The competition aims to generate interest in scientific study through investigative-type projects and at the same time, acts as a platform for schools to share their findings. Every year, more than 100 teams compete in the various categories : Primary 3 and 4, Primary 5 and 6, Secondary 1 and 2.


5) Science Talent Programme (STP)

Our STP is a two-year enriched curriculum differentiated for selected students who show great aptitude and strong interest in Science. Students in the programme are stretched through Olympiad trainings and given opportunities to participate in external Science competitions that go beyond the curriculum. Our students from STP have done well in the various competitions this year.
