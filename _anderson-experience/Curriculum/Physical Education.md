**Vision**

We envision **healthy Andersonians** who actively engage in sports throughout their lives.

**Mission**

Our mission is to **promote a lifelong healthy lifestyle** by encouraging physical activity and proper nutrition through **fun and exciting activities**.

**Subjects offered by Department**

Physical Education

**Key programmes of Department**

**Physical Education Programme**

Our PE lessons follow the **Games Concept Approach (GCA)**. Andersonians explore a variety of sports across major categories (invasion, target, striking/fielding, and net barrier). The GCA approach fosters the development of both **psychomotor** and **thinking skills** in sport learning. Here are the sports and games taught at each level:

·        **Secondary 1**: Badminton & Principles of Games / Gaelic Football

·        **Secondary 2:** Basketball & Football

·        **Secondary 3:** Ultimate Frisbee & Floorball

·        **Secondary 4:** Softball

**Assessment:**

Students are assessed in three domains:

1.      Cognitive Domain: Knowledge and understanding of sports concepts.

2.      Physical Domain: Demonstration of motor skills and teamwork learned during PE lessons.

3.      Affective Domain: Students receive credit or penalties based on positive or negative behaviour displayed during PE.

**Technology Integration:**

We leverage ICT platforms such as **SLS (Student Learning Space)** and **Personal Learning Devices** to enhance learning at all levels.

**Sports Events**  
  
1. Annual Cross Country:

Held at the end of Term 2 each year. The run is about 3km long and has been held at the Sports Hub for the past few years. It is a fun filled event with students running along the scenic route towards Marina Bay and Benjamin Sheares bridge. There are many activity booths set up by students for their peers to participate and have fun while waiting for their turn to run.

**Outdoor Adventure Learning**

Our students get opportunities to learn and experience various outdoor skills and activities during their time in Anderson.

**Sec 1 students** participate in a **3D2N residential camp** while our **Sec 3 students** embark on a **4D3N residential camp**. Students take part in various activities which include low elements, outdoor cooking, water activities such as rafting as well as place-based activities such as coastal exploration. It is a fun, enriching and exciting experience for Andersonians.

**Sec 2 students** go on a **Nature Trail walk**. Some the routes include the Treetop Walk which entails a moderately easy hike covering 7km to 8km and the Dairy Farm Nature Park trail to Bukit Timah which presents a more challenging terrain totaling 4km to 5km. Students get to experience the nature side of Singapore and learn more about the tropical rainforests.

**Student Leadership**

The **Anderson Health Leaders** actively contribute to the Physical Education Department by participating in various sports events and promoting healthy lifestyle programs. Their role is crucial in ensuring the smooth execution of inter-class games and the Annual Cross Country. During PE lessons, Health Leaders take charge of activities like warm-up sessions and provide valuable support to PE teachers in managing logistics and administrative tasks.
