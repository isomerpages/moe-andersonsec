**Key programmes of Department**

The Humanities department continues to use inquiry-based learning as the key pedagogical approach to develop students’ knowledge, skills and values through the various humanities subjects. Students also develop their critical thinking skills through authentic learning experiences, collaborative research and interactions with relevant stakeholders. Through these multiple approaches, the department aims to provide a forward-looking and vibrant learner-centered humanities education in a volatile and changing world. 
 
In line with the school’s direction to foster critical thinking and enhance global awareness, the department’s Current Affairs Reading Programme aims to help students better understand the interconnectedness of Singapore and the world they live in, and to appreciate the complexities of the human experience. Students are engaged in a weekly reading activity through selected articles on some of the latest developments around the world and in Singapore. And they can now also watch the latest news ‘live’ on their Personal Learning Devices during their reading sessions.

The department also provides opportunities for students to develop a deeper understanding of the subjects’ discipline by organising learning journeys to collect evidence in support of their investigative projects. The Geography unit has conducted fieldwork for students to collect geographical and spatial data to learn about tropical rainforests, climate and the impact of tourism; while the History unit has facilitated learning journeys to Fort Siloso at Sentosa for students to study the British defence of Singapore during World War II. The Social Studies unit also has guided students to analyse social issues in depth through Issue Investigation tasks conducted through interviews and research studies. All these efforts strive to promote collaborative and self-directed learning through authentic performance tasks.

Our students also have had the opportunity to participate in competitions such as the NUS Geography Challenge and MOE History Challenge. We are delighted to share that the team for the NUS Geography Challenge successfully clinched one Gold, one Silver and two Bronze medals. The department will strive to groom more humanities talents and enrich their experiences in learning more about the humanities in different contexts!
