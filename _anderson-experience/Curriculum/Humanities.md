**Key Programmes of Department**

The Humanities department continues to use inquiry-based learning as the key pedagogical approach to develop students’ knowledge, skills and values through the various humanities subjects. Students also develop their critical thinking skills through authentic learning experiences, collaborative research and interactions with relevant stakeholders. Through these multiple approaches, the department aims to provide a forward-looking and vibrant learner-centered humanities education in a volatile and changing world.

In line with the school’s direction to foster critical thinking and enhance global awareness, the department’s Current Affairs Reading Programme aims to help students better understand the interconnectedness of Singapore and the world they live in, and to appreciate the complexities of the human experience. Students are engaged in a fortnightly reading activity through selected articles on some of the latest developments around the world and in Singapore. The annual Humanities Week also invites students to reflect on their learning through exposure of the various Humanities disciplines.

The department also provides opportunities for students to develop a deeper understanding of the subjects’ discipline by organizing learning journeys (LJ) to collect evidence in support of their investigative projects. At lower secondary, learning journeys are designed for breadth and exposure to the Humanities, such as the Sec 1 LJ to the Singapore River. At upper secondary, the learning experiences are designed to build disciplinary perspectives and skills. The Geography unit has conducted learning journeys to collect geographical and spatial data to learn about everyday geographies, while the History unit has facilitated learning journeys to various historical sites to gain authentic experiences of pre-independence Singapore. In addition, the Social Studies unit has guided students to analyze social issues in depth through Issue Investigation tasks conducted through interviews and research studies. All these efforts strive to promote collaborative and self-directed learning through authentic performance tasks.

Our students also have had the opportunity to participate in competitions such as the NUS Geography Challenge and MOE History Challenge. We are delighted to share that the team for the NUS Geography Challenge 2024 successfully made it to the Grand Finals and emerged Top 5. The department will strive to groom more humanities talents and enrich their experiences in learning more about the humanities in different contexts!
