**Background**

The Elementz Science Competition has a rich legacy of promoting scientific research and inquiry-based learning. The interest in developing scientific research capabilities in North Zone schools started when a group of principals and teachers who returned from an overseas learning journey in the late 1990s. This was followed by the inception of the Elementz Science Research Conference and Exhibition for upper secondary and junior college students in 2001. To further promote an interest in science research among the lower secondary and primary school students, the Elementz Science Project Competition and Exhibition started in 2003 in Anderson Secondary School.
