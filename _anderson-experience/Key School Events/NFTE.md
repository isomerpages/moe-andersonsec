**NFTE Youth Entrepreneurship Challenge 2020**

**The NFTE Journey**

Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship  (NFTE, pronounced as ‘nifty’) is a funded programme designed to activate the entrepreneurial mindset and build business skills in youth from underserved communities. NFTE’s innovative, hands-on curriculum allows young people to learn entrepreneurial skills and attitudes through activities such as opportunity recognition and market research.

**About NYEC**

The 60-hour NFTE programme culminates in NFTE Youth Entrepreneurship Challenge (NYEC) where the top 3 students from each NFTE school will be pitching their bausiness ideas to a panel of esteemed judges from various industries. NYEC consists of three main components: NYEC Level Up, NYEC Finals, and NYEC Grand Finale.

**NYEC Level Up**

NYEC Level Up is a 3-day intensive where the top 3 students of each NFTE school work with business mentors on their business plans, prototypes and pitches.

**NYEC Finals**

NYEC Finals is a business pitching competition when students present their business ideas to a panel of judges from different industries. At this stage, 6 finalists will emerge and advance to the Grand Finale.

**NYEC Grand Finale**

NYEC Grand Finale is the celebration of every participant’s journey through NYEC. All NYEC participants will be showcasing their business pitches in a Virtual Showcase over Instagram where the audience is able to vote for the ‘Most Investible Idea’. The top 6 finalists will then be invited to pitch before a panel of distinguished judges for the last time. The winner of NYEC Grand Finale will represent Singapore as our Global Young Entrepreneur at the NFTE Global Showcase in New York City in the following year.
