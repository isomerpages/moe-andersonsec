At the heart of what Anderson Student Council does is to serve the school and its community, and the focus in 2021 is on enlivening school experiences for all students and staff. Our councillors innovated creative ways to engage and create positive experiences for the student body, despite facing constraints and challenges over social interactions due to the pandemic. 

In 2021, we started our first radio show in August, titled “Ande FM 3001”. Through this weekly radio broadcast, students and staff dedicated songs and messages of encouragement are read out to the recipients in school. This brought about hope and positivity every morning. 

On top of that, our student leaders continued to reach out to the students in order to maintain the bridge of communications. We held our Presidential Elections Campaign in March as well as the annual recruitment tea session in April where potential applicants could find out more about the Student Council.
