Anderson Choir provides many platforms for character building, leadership and vocal talent development. Not only that, our choristers are engaged in bonding activities and programmes that help them strengthen teamwork and cultivate good values. Over the years, our choristers have participated in meaningful events, such as school choir exchange programmes, public performances and the biennial Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Competition to showcase their vocal talents. Anderson Choir is a place of hope for aspiring young vocal performers. Even in these challenging pandemic times, the Anderson Choir leverages the latest technology to provide online training and lesson packages in music theory, vocal techniques and audio recording. Our choristers will continue to strive for excellence and sing in harmony, looking forward to delighting audiences with beautiful melodies.
