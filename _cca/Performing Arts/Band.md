Anderson Military Band (AMB) participated in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) 2021 on 6th April and 7th April at the Singapore Conference Hall. This year, two band ensembles, comprising 25 students, represented our school. The junior band ensemble and the main band consisted of students mostly from the lower secondary and the upper secondary respectively.

What was particularly unique to this yearâ€™s SYF competition was that the school was represented by two ensembles. This presented a unique synergy between both ensembles as the main band was a constant source of motivation for the junior band to strive harder to achieve a higher standard of musicality. As both bands continued to work hard towards reaching their goals for their ensembles, they both carried the hope to attain the best they could during this competition. 

The objective of the biennial competition is to celebrate the achievements of youths in co-curricular activities (CCAs). Our AMB students worked hard to overcome certain challenges, such as conducting regular sectionals over video-call sessions, and even adjusting to the new protocol required during the actual SYF. Students were given multiple opportunities to work together over this period of time to hone and refine their skills in playing their instruments, as well as forge and strengthen friendships. Last but not least, students worked closely together towards achieving a common and shared experience together as AMB.
