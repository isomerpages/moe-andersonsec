Anderson Chinese Dance believes in opportunities for all and values diligence and teamwork to achieve the best outcomes for our dancers. Persevering through strenuous rounds of practice for each performance, our dancers gained important life skills like problem solving and resilience. Committed to serve the school and the community, our dancers earnestly put in their best to performances during school events, such as the Chinese New Year celebrations concert. As part of technique building and equipping our dancers with various skills, our dancers also attend a workshop on make-up that allows them to experiment with various styles of make-up to suit different occasions. 
In the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation 2021, our dancers courageously put up an exceptional performance entitled <念∙念> that was exclusively choreographed by our resident instructor, Ms Jenny Neo, and clinched the Certificate of Distinction!
