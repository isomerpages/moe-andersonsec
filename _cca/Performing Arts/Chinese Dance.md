<p><strong>Chinese Dance</strong>
</p>
<p>As a Performing Arts Group, the students in Chinese Dance are able to
hone their individual dance skills and work together towards common goals.
In the process of acquiring the skills in dance, students will have a deeper
appreciation for the traditional Chinese culture and learn its inherent
values. Students develop pleasant temperament as they learn to express
the different emotions through various dance moves. The skills acquired
will prepare the students for further study should they wish to pursue
dance at professional levels in future and become active contributors to
the local and global dance scenes.</p>
