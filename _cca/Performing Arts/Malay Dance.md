Anderson Malay Dance has had a fruitful and successful year in spite of the pandemic. The dancers were dedicated and committed, rehearsing with purpose and pride for the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation 2021, whether in person or over Zoom. They did not allow the various changes in safe management measures (SMM) to affect their aspirations and were understandably overjoyed to attain the Certificate of Distinction for their stellar performance. Anderson Malay Dance will continue to aspire to the highest in character, values and skills, and bring joy to all through their love for dance.
