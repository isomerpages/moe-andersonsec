<p><strong>Malay Dance</strong>
</p>
<p>Hayunan Seni in ANDSS believes that every student has the potential and
thus aims to develop their talent and build self-confidence in them.&nbsp;Dancers
learn the importance of teamwork, resilience and commitment as well as
always giving their best in their endeavours.&nbsp;They are focussed in
not only perfecting their dance routines but also in immersing themselves
in the rich Malay heritage and culture despite the diversity. The camaraderie
forged within the members through the many platforms like performances
and activities is also a highlight for the dancers.&nbsp;Together as one,
thatâ€™s the aspiration of Hayunan Seni.</p>
