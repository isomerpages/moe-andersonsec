<p>
<br>Anderson Student Council (ASC) is a family of student leaders that work
together to enliven the school experience through signature initiatives
like Dress Down Day and the inter-class Challenge Shield. Student Councillors
also spearhead and contribute actively to school-wide events such as the
Secondary 1 Orientation, Teachers’ Day celebrations, and the Secondary
4 and 5 Graduation Night.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Beyond events, ASC also strives to foster a more caring and inclusive
school environment. Our Secondary 2 councillors embark on Friend of Singa
(FOS) kindness projects, and our student DJs host weekly AndeRadio sessions
to bring some cheer to students on Thursday mornings. The Andersonian of
the Month initiative, first piloted as a FOS project, has been an important
avenue for students to recognise their peers for their character and talents.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Over the years, ASC has played a crucial role in being a bridge between
the staff and student body. The Thinkers Dot Com Student Forum was introduced
in 2022 as an opportunity for Andersonians to contribute quality ideas
for improving the student experience and share them with the school management.
From 2025, ASC is hosting the Student Leaders’ Congress dialogue sessions
as a platform for student leaders to collectively contribute and develop
ideas for school improvement.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through these opportunities and experiences, our Student Councillors develop
themselves into confident leaders of exemplary character, modelling the
way for their peers. They also learn what it means to serve others with
humility and give back to the school community.</p>
