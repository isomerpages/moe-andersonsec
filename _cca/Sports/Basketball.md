(Boys & Girls)

Our boys and girls develop core competencies in the sport as well as build physical stamina and mental resilience. Another important aspect of the training involves tactical planning and designing strategies for game play. 

Equally valuable are the life lessons and ethics learned in the sport – team communication, sportsmanship, coping with failures and the value of sheer hard work. The coaches and teachers work together towards uplifting our students and helping them understand how each member matters in this team sport. 

The covid-19 situation has continued to create several challenges for our students this year. However, the students have remained optimistic and adaptable. During e-CCA sessions, they continued with their physical training and sustained their enthusiasm about the national competitions. There were changes in the rules of the game, like “3 vs 3”, challenging our students to learn the new rules quickly. Owing to safe management measures, the national competitions were not held eventually. The students, however, did not let this dampen their spirits. In fact, they learnt and accepted that in this VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous) world, they cannot stop changes from happening. They can instead choose to make the best out of opportunities thrown up by crises and adopt the right attitudes of always being aware and prepared.
