<p><strong>FOOTBALL</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anderson Football aims to develop our members to be better individuals
who display good self-discipline, team spirit, and conduct of true gentlemen.
In every training session, the teachers and coach maximise every opportunity
to develop self-discipline and the ‘team above self’ spirit in our boys.
Use of appropriate language and proper conduct during and post-training
are also emphasised during our training sessions.</p>
<p>With the resumption of National School Games (NSG), our ‘B’ division team
improved in their performance, and we attained fourth position in League
3 of the competition in 2023.</p>
<p>Our members uphold our school values, and we will continue to train ourselves
diligently towards self-improvement, in order to become better players
and active contributors to our society.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
