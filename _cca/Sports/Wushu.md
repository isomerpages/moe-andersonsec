Wushu is all about striving for the best and overcoming one’s challenges.  Anderson Wushu team has shown that spirit once again in the 2021 National School Games! In view of the covid-19 situation, training and competition were carried out in unconventional ways involving a mix of virtual and physical modes. Virtual training requires a lot of self-discipline and control that is not in short supply among our students as they imbibe these values during each training. 

Our students competed without the presence of the audience and their teammates as they had to be recorded individually at the MOECCA Branch. Our students, nonetheless, persevered and showed strong confidence and mental resilience in spite of the absence of cheering by an audience, which would have been a great source of motivation for them, and went on to achieve greatly, as evident from the number of awards won. Amidst the challenges faced, the students not only maintained their track records but made great improvements. Both the ‘B’ Division boys and girls made us proud! Kudos to our Wushu members!
