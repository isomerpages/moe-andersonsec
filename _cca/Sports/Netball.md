<p><strong>NETBALL</strong>
</p>
<p>The Girls in Anderson Netball Team, also known as GIANT, is a group of
like-minded individuals with the passion for netball. &nbsp;We believe
that no amount of talent can make up for the lack of practice. We exemplify
the name GIANT by always standing tall in the face of adversity and staying
poise under pressure.</p>
<p>Through the rigorous training sessions, the girls build resilience and
mental toughness, and push themselves to achieve their fullest potential.
Moreover, the strong camaraderie among the girls enables them to work towards
common goals while creating lasting memories both on and off court.</p>
<p>The GIANT has come a long way in establishing itself as a worthy opponent
in many competitions including the North Zone and National School Games
Netball Championships.&nbsp;In 2024, the ‘B’ Division GIANT made the school
proud by emerging as Top 8 in the National Round.</p>
