The National School Games is the largest annual inter-school competition in Singapore. Participation and competitions play an important role in the character development of the Netballers as they pursue sporting excellence. This opportunity to demonstrate their skills allowed the students to put their training into action gameplay. The Netballers gained important hands-on experiences, providing them opportunity to grow in the area of sports and netball. The Netballers demonstrated resilience and determination going up against Singapore Sports School, our arch-rival. The game eventually ended in a tie of 29 â€“ 29, but it was a win in our hearts as we put up a tough fight and even took the lead at one stage in the game.
