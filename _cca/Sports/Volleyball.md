Changes are always difficult and uncomfortable. Covid-19 pandemic has brought upon many changes to our co-curricular activity but each time, these changes were overcome by a resilient mindset and can-do attitude adopted by our Volleyball players. Limitations such as the new norm of training and the format of game did not discourage our Volleyball players. Our players forged ahead in the National Schools North Zone ‘C’ Divisions Girls championships games where they played in 3 versus 3 volleyball competitions. It was truly memorable as it was our players’ first time in a novel competition setting. 
Our Captain, Alexis from class 3/2, reflected, “I have faced a few challenges during the matches, and I overcame them by trying my very best to stay calm and return to the game after losing a set through staying focused, determined and not giving up until the very last point. I will definitely train hard for ‘B’ division next year and motivate my team members to do the same”. 
“Be comfortable being uncomfortable” is a quote that resonates with our players. Our Volleyball team will train with insights gleaned from this year’s competitions for the betterment of the sport.
