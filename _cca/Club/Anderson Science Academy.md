Anderson Science Academy is a mentor-based co-curricular activity (CCA) where our members are provided with opportunities to engage in active learning through investigative research projects, learning journeys and attachments to institutes of higher learning. The CCA aims to develop students’ analytical and problem-solving skills and also allow students to learn collaboratively with their teammates. Through our partnerships with institutes of higher learning, our students learn and interact with science and engineering lecturers to improve their scientific knowledge and experimentation skills. Our research labs are also well-equipped with data-loggers and high-end scientific instruments like the Ion Exchange Chromatography and UV Spectrophotometer to enhance our students’ learning.
