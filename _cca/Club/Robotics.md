For more than a decade, Anderson Robotics has never failed to provide the opportunity for students to strengthen leadership skills, learn to cooperate with others, improve social interaction skills, better regulate emotions, and learn the highs and lows of competing. Our activities are designed and centred around the three core principles of computational thinking, self-directed learning and personalized learning. Even during the pandemic period, our students were still actively engaged in building and programming robots through virtual simulation. 

Through participating in the various competitions, our students learn to work together as a team to achieve a common goal. This has nurtured them to solve problems creatively, master teamwork and enable friendships to grow and flourish. It has also taught every member the value of being able to collaborate with one another, be open to new ideas, be critical in new endeavours and be bold to take decisive actions. In this way, they lay the solid foundations for their future careers and endeavours.
