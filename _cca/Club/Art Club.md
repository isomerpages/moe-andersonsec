The Art Club focuses on bringing students together to participate in developing and interpreting ideas, concepts and communication through visual means. Students are involved in creating visual, auditory or performance works that express their imagination and creativity. Students also pick up knowledge and skills in making 2D or 3D artworks using a variety of media. Through the visual explorations, the Art Club cultivates and nurtures students to be not only self-directed and confident, but also work collaboratively with others.
