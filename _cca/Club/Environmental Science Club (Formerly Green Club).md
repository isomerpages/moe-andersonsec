Environmental Club (Former Green Club) 
The mission of the Environmental Club, aim to foster a deep sense of respect and care for the environment within both our school and the wider community. Our goal is to inspire everyone to play an active role in supporting the Singapore Green Plan 2030, a national initiative aimed at combating climate change and promoting sustainability.
The Green Club strives to go beyond simply educating our members on sustainable practices. We actively seek out external partnerships to broaden their perspectives and deepen their understanding of environmental issues. Through collaborations with organizations such as the National Environment Agency (NEA), Nature Society Singapore, and Cornerstone Community Service in which our members have gained invaluable learning experiences. One such initiative was the Barn AMK Secondhand Clothes Donation Drive, made possible through our new partnership with Cornerstone Community Service. This community service project offered our members an invaluable learning experience. One of our proudest achievements in 2024 was the Bronze Award in the Climate Crisis Challenge organised by GreenSg Collab which has inspired the club to continue exploring innovative ways to promote biodiversity. Our club has also contributed to the school’s achievement of the SEC School Green Award “The Yellow Flame” Award for 2024. 
In addition to these external learning opportunities, our members are empowered to take leadership roles in organising and executing their own environmental initiatives such as our upcycling workshops, designed to promote eco-friendly habits.
Our club also emphasizes hands-on learning and a direct connection to nature. Through meaningful weekly gardening activities and garden tours, our members gain a deeper appreciation for food production and sustainability. These experiences allow them to witness the importance of environmental conservation firsthand.
As we continue to nurture our members to be more environmentally conscious individuals, the Environmental Club remains committed in promoting sustainable practices and inspiring positive change both in our school and beyond.
