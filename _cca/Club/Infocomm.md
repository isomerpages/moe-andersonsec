<p><strong>Infocomm Club</strong>
</p>
<p>The Infocomm Club is a dynamic hub of technological expertise and creative
flair. The dedicated members are primarily responsible for managing the
school's sound systems and capturing memorable moments of schoolâ€™s events
through photography and videography. Club members work tirelessly behind
the scenes of exhilarating concerts and weekly assemblies to ensure that
the audio-visual experiences for the audiences are flawless. The students
collaborate directly with teachers and can work independently as they handle
the various technical requirements, which is evident of their maturity
and professionalism. Beyond technical knowledge, the members of the Infocomm
Club also embody teamwork, adaptability, and a commitment to excellence.</p>
