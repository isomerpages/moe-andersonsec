Anderson NPCC Unit has a proud tradition of nurturing outstanding cadets through a combination of tough yet fulfilling training since it was established in 1964. Cadets undergo training activities aligned with the schoolâ€™s ANDE values and the core NPCC values of resilience, leadership and integrity, which strongly impacts the way cadets conduct themselves.

In 2021, cadets participated actively to share their knowledge of being vigilant against online scams, through the booth exhibition organised by the Ang Mo Kio South NPC and the Secondary Two cadets, and by sharing of SG Secure messages through the morning reading sessions. The Secondary One cadets also showed exemplary resilience during the Air Pistol shooting enrichment programme, as they pushed themselves out of their comfort zone to do the best they could. Last but not least, the Secondary Three cadets have shown deep self-discipline and leadership in the way they have led the unit to greater heights despite the pandemic.
