<p><strong>Anderson National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC)</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>CCA Programmes &amp; Achievements</strong>
</p>
<p>Anderson NPCC Unit has a proud tradition of nurturing outstanding cadets
through a combination of tough yet fulfilling training since it was established
in 1964. Cadets undergo training activities aligned with the schoolâ€™s ANDE
values and the core NPCC values of resilience, leadership, and integrity,
which strongly impacts the way cadets conduct themselves.</p>
<p>In 2023, cadets participated actively to share their knowledge of being
vigilant against online scams, through an Instagram Live organised by the
Ang Mo Kio South NPC and the Secondary Three cadets, and by sharing of
SG Secure messages through booths during the upper and lower secondary
recesses/lunch breaks. The Secondary One and Two cadets also showed exemplary
resilience during the annual Air Pistol shooting enrichment programme,
as they pushed themselves out of their comfort zones to do the best they
could. &nbsp;Last but not least, the Secondary Three cadets have shown
deep self-discipline and leadership in the way they have led the unit to
greater heights despite the pandemic.</p>
<p>In 2023, we sent a team of Secondary 2 and Secondary 3 students to participate
in the inaugural Crime Scene Investigation competition and was awarded
the second runner-up amongst 123 other schools. We also participated in
the national ARTrack competition whereby our Cadet managed to be one of
the finalists to get her artwork showcased within MRT stations.</p>
<p>Finally, we are proud to announce that we have once again achieved UOPA
Distinction, a benchmark we have held since 2017.</p>
