<p><strong>CCA Programmes &amp; Achievements</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Anderson NCC unit cadets participate in various military activities
such as Urban Operations, Freestyle Drill, Precision Rifle Drill and Parade
Drill training. They also develop their resilience and teamwork through
training camps. Their physical fitness is also cultivated through Physical
Fitness training and Sports Championship Games (Captain’s Ball, Frisbee,
Soccer).</p>
<p>In addition, our unit actively hosts our CN4 Cluster units in annual Cluster
Sharing events during our March holiday camp. Cadets from all the units
share and learn a lot from one another in areas such as Precision Drill,
Freestyle Drill and Urban Operations.</p>
<p>Anderson NCC cadets also collaborate with various beneficiary/charitable
organisations such as Ang Mo Kio Comnet Senior Service in various VIA activities
such as mass-singing and area cleaning. Our cadets develop their civic
mindedness and socio-emotional skills through these VIA activities.</p>
<p>Lastly, our unit has upheld a longstanding history of achieving Distinctions
in the Annual Unit Recognition award. We also consistently develop our
senior cadet leaders to achieve the Outstanding Cadet Award.</p>
<p><strong>Reflections from our cadets</strong>
</p>
<p>“During February 2023, Anderson NCC unit participated in the annual FSD
competition. Central District units gathered at Nan Chiau High School for
the competition. Anderson NCC prepared very well and put in a lot of hard
work since the start of 2023 for the competition. We performed very well,
and this experience will be useful in our development for future FSD competitions.”
– MSG Ma Zi Jie</p>
<p>“During the Orienteering competition, our Anderson NCC team navigated
around NCC HQ against 30 other school unit teams. I also met my cousin
as he was a Cadet Officer volunteering at NCC HQ. We learned valuable lessons
together and we seek to improve our map reading, compass and communication
skills.” – LCP Archer Ong</p>
<p>“During the VIA, I was in charge of singing songs to the elderly while
also performing hand gestures for the elderly. The elderly enjoyed singing
together with us and even came to the front to sing songs or dance together
with us. The elderly also seemed to enjoy the variety of songs we chose
to sing with them. The VIA helped me to connect and learn from the elderly
more intimately than I could have done anywhere else. It allowed me to
interact more with the elderly while having a memorable experience for
both the elderly and the cadets.” – SSG Aiman</p>
