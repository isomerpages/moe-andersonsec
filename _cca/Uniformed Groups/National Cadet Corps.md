NCC training sessions are conducted every Monday and Wednesday. Training sessions involve physical training and practical lessons, such as orienteering and Urban Operations. These activities develop our cadets to be physically fit and mentally resilient and flexible as they respond to different threats. NCC also seeks to develop regimental discipline through foot and precision rifle drills.

2021 was remarkable as it marked a frequent continual switch between online and face-to-face NCC activities. Nonetheless, our cadets demonstrated their passion and commitment in their efforts during the training sessions in both modes. 

Our cadets started 2021 with our CCA Open House presentation, showcasing our exciting Urban Operations exercise. Our cadets displayed resilience and adaptability during the Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) period when new safe management measures came into effect, by pivoting to online training sessions via Zoom, footdrill instruction through senior-junior pairing and online completion of various cadet assessments.

As a mark of their passion and commitment towards NCC, two Alumni cadets return to Anderson to continue to serve our unit after they have completed their Cadet Officer course.
