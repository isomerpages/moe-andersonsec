<p><strong>Anderson Girl Guides</strong>
</p>
<p>Anderson Clover Guides aims to enable Guides to develop their fullest
potential and grow as responsible citizens of Singapore. The Guiding programme
teaches Guides vital life skills – such as personal goal-setting, decision-making
and team-building – in a safe and supportive environment. Girl Guides build
and strengthen their leadership skills by taking the lead in Unit and Patrol
activities, learning to organise events as well as teaching each other
and younger Guides new skills. They have also taken the lead in giving
back to the larger community through Values-In-Action programme with Sree
Narayana Mission Home, where in 2023, the Guides taught the elderly how
to make stickers and interacted with them.</p>
<p>As part of the Guide unit’s outdoor training programme, the Guides participated
in a 3D2N training camp in school in 2024. The main activities of the camp
included team building games, combined Uniformed Group (UG) activities
with NCC and NPCC, camp craft, outdoor cooking, pioneering, litter picking
and a Finale performance event by the different patrols on the second night.
For some of the Guides, it was their first time cooking outdoors as a patrol
and working with other UG members for combined UG activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
various activities allowed the seniors and juniors to gain a better understanding
towards one another as well as have a greater level of compassion for the
larger community.</p>
