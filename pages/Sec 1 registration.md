<p><strong>P Welcome Address</strong>
</p>
<p>Dear Secondary 1 students of 2025 (or our THINKERS)</p>
<p>Welcome to Anderson Secondary School! We are delighted that you have chosen
us for the next phase of your educational journey, and look forward to
welcoming you with a 5-day orientation programme beginning from the first
day you join the school on 2 January next year.</p>
<p>While you may be nervous about the transition to secondary school, rest
assured that your seniors and teachers will be here to look out and care
for you. You have many new adventures ahead of you, from new subjects to
new friendships, and increased opportunities to take up leadership roles
to benefit both your immediate community, as well as larger society.</p>
<p>2025 is also Anderson Secondary Schoolâ€™s 65th anniversary, and you will
be able to look forward to many exciting activities that will hopefully
knit you and peers closer together, as well as strengthen your sense of
belonging to the school. Come prepared to participate as well as contribute.
As our school aims to develop all of you as thinkers, innovators and leaders
who make a difference for the greater good, you will have ample platforms
to imagine possibilities, exercise your voice responsibly, and make a tangible
impact on the lives of others.</p>
<p>As with previous years, you do not have to report to school physically
for Secondary 1 registration. However, please read through and follow the
instructions on our website and Parents Gateway carefully, to complete
the registration process. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to
contact the school, and we will assist you.</p>
<p>Thank you and enjoy the rest of your vacation. I look forward to meeting
all of you in the new year.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Ms Tan Po Chin</p>
<p>Principal</p>
